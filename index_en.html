                            This document describes the basic technical specifications for the product under certification.It is important  to detail the following items:<br><br>

                            - Frequency Banda<br>
                            - Technologies<br>
                            - Product Application<br>
                            - Where the Product is installed<br>
                            - If the product cn be operated by the final user or Just by specialized professionals<br>
                            - How the product is supplied (Ex: battery, power supply, car charger, USB...etc)<br>

                            It is very important to provide a complete technical specification in the moment the quote is requested in order to guarantee the agility and precision of your request. Technical Specifications not too precise can generate not only delays, but also reworks and unexpected additional costs.<br>

                            In case your product is a cable or connector, for example, you can only present this technical specification instead of a manual.
