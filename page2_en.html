                - Send the product specification containing the complete information regarding the product, as items below. The complete information avoids rework, unexpected delays and costs in the process:<br><br>

                - Frequency Band<br>
                - Applicable Technologies<br>
                - Product Application<br>
                - Where the product is installed<br>
                - If the product can be operated by the final user or only by professionals<br>
                - How the product is supplied (Example: battery, power supply, car charger, USB ... etc);<br>
                - When preparing the samples for the shipment, make sure they are correctly identified with model name.<br><br>
                Example: If the model name of the product under certification is "Model X", it is very important that the samples have a label or any identification that shows this model name;<br>
                - When sending the samples to the Versys it is highly recommended that you describe on the package, the Versys project number and also send instructions for testing.<br><br>
                With this, the project can be identified quickly and with the instructions we can interact with the laboratory in order to speed up the testing;<br>
                - Send all documents before the issuance of the test reports. With this, we will avoid delays, as we can have partial evaluations and provide you a feedback confirming if corrections are needed or not.<br>
