                                      - Submit the technical specification of the product containing all the complete information of the product, according to items below. This avoids reworks, delays and unexpected costs in the process:<br>
                                    - Product operating frequency<br>
                                    - Applicable technologies <br>
                                    - Product application<br>
                                    - Installation site<br>
                                    - If the product can be operated by a common user or only by specialized professionals<br>
                                    - Supply of the product (e.g. battery, power supply, car charger, USB, etc.)<br>
                                    - When preparing the samples for submission, assures that they are properly identified. <br>
                                    e.g. If the model of the product under certification is "model X", it is very important that there is a label in the samples or any kind of identification showing this model name described in the product;
                                    - When submitting the samples to Laboratory is recommended to specify the number of the process (Versys process number) in the package and that there are instructions for carrying the tests.<br>
                                    This way, the project is quickly identified and we can quickly interact with the laboratory with the instructions, in order also to expedite the performance of the tests;
                                    - Refer all documentation of the certification process before the issuance of the tests reports. With that, we can avoid delays and perform a partial assessment of what has been sent to provide you with a feedback on possible necessary corrections;<br>
